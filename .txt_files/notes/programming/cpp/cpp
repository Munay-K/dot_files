Best practices{{{

Use the correct types when iterating in an iterable object {{{

}}}
Use '.at()' when trying to access to an element from a vector {{{

This way you assure yourself that the element exist. If it doesn't exist, you will get an error, so you'll know when you're accessing a forbidden memory space.

Language structures {{{

static {{{

static variable inside of a class/struct
	- There is going only to be one instance of that variable across all instances of the class.

static method inside of a class/struct:
	- A static method can be called without a class instance and inside.
	- Inside a static method you cannot write code which refers to a class instance since you don't have that class instance.

static outside of a class/struct
static variables declared globally
	- It's like declaring a variable private in a class.
	- No other translation unit will see that variable.
	- The variable will be only visible to that translation unit.

FAQ {{{

What is a translation unit? {{{

A translation unit is the basic unit of compilation of C++. This unit is made up of the contents of a single source file after it passes through preprocessing. It contains included any header files without blocks that are ignored using conditional preprocessing statements life ifdef, ifndef, etc.
Note that a header file is not a translation unit. However, it can be included in translation units.
This means that a translation unit is everything that can be compiled on its own? Not really, some translation units relie on some libraries that has to be linked using the proper 'g++' commands.

}}}
What is external linking {{{

When you call to a variable from a file A on file B by using 'extern' and the same name of the variable from file A.

}}}
When should I use 'static' in variables or functions? {{{

This question is a little bit similar to the question 'Why would you use 'private' on a class?

Try name your functions and your variables static unless you actually need them to be linked across translation units.

}}}
What are some cases in which global variables is considered a good practice? {{{
