Notes {{{3

- Even though you can select files by using 'ya' or 'da' to copy or move files (which may lead to some confusions), the action (copy or move files) that persists depends on the last keybinding used 'ya' for copying files and 'da' for moving files. This is true even though a group of files where yanked by using 'yy' or 'dd'.
