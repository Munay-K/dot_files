Code cleaners {{{

:%s:\s\+$::
	Drops the blanks at the end of the line. Those lines in which there are only blank spaces will be reduced to an empty line.
:%s:\(\S.*\)\@<=\s\+$::
	Drops the blanks at the end of the line. Those lines in which there are only blank spaces won't be modified.
:g/^$/,/./-j
	Reduce multiple blank lines (only empty lines, those with singlespaces won't be affected) to a single line.
:g/^\s*$/,/./-j
	Reduce multiple blank lines (only lines that only contain whitespace characters) to a single line.

Some basic tricks {{{

Miscelanous {{{

:g/<h[12]>/t$
	Copies all lines that contain <h1> or <h2> at the end of the file.
:g/pattern/m$
	Moves all lines matching a pattern to end of file.
qaq:g/pattern/d A
	qaq (clear register "a" by recording an empty macro), d (delete match) A (append ro register "a", if it's lowercase then the last match will only be saved into the given register.)
qaq:g/pattern/y A
	qaq (clear register "a" by recording an empty macro), y (yank match) A (append ro register "a", if it's 'a' then the last match will only be saved into the 'a' register.)
:g/pattern/z#.5
	Display context (5 lines) for all occurrences of a pattern. If not the beginning/end of the document, the matched pattern will apear at the middle of the lines given (in this case, 5).
:g/pattern/"_d
	Optimized deletion of all lines matching a pattern ("_ makes vim yank to the blackhole register which does makes Vim not to copy each match to a register.)

}}}
Break my file {{{

%s/\d/0/g
	Change all digits.
%s/\l/a/g
	Change all lowercase letters.
%s/\u/A/g
	Change all uppercase letters.

nnoremap <silent> <Leader>bf mw:%s/\d/0/g <bar> %s/\l/a/g <bar> %s/\u/A/g <bar> noh<CR><CR>`w
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>bf mw:%s/\d/0/g \| %s/\l/a/g \| %s/\u/A/g \| noh<CR><CR>`w
	Execute some commands that make the file unrecognizable.

}}}

}}}
Some advanced tricks {{{

:g/.\n\n\@!/norm o
	Adds a white line after each line
:exe 'g/^/let @x = len(getline(".")) | normal "xPa ' | sort n | :g//normal dw
	Ascendent sorting by length.
:exe 'g/^/let @x = len(getline(".")) | normal "xPa ' | sort! n | :g//normal dw
	Descendent sorting by length.
%! [cmd]
	Replaces the content of the file with the output of that command.
