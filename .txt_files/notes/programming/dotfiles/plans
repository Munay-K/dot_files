	- Forms for different languages.
	- Warning forms that depends on the length from the database column.
	- "global" keyword in Python and how it can be used to share variables across different files to have a single max_length that is shared between forms and the database. There shouldn't be magic numbers, just a single number that is shared across the form, model, etc.

Unnecesary {{{

Key-b that changes the cwd to the directory where the file is, open NERDTree, make the cwd be the same as it was before. {{{

Why is this unncesary?
	It is more convenient to open NERDTree in the directory where the file from the current buffer is, this way it is not necessary to change the current working directory. Note that this is what I wanted to accomplish in the first place, but then I realize that you can toggle the NERDTree menu on a given directory.

}}}
Appending files to current buffer using the NERDTree menu. {{{

Notes
	When being on the NERDTree menu, the created keybinding should append that file into the file that toggled the NERDTree menu.
	NERDTree knows which buffer toggled it, since when you open a file from the NERDTree menu, that file is opened in that buffer.
Why is this unncesary?
	The main objective of creating this keybinding was to append '.gitignore's files on the fly, since my '.gitignore' templates have been created with the v4 separator. Now that I'm using 'set foldmethod=marker' to improve the readibility of my code, this keybinding would be useless.

- Start using abbreviations to get rid of UltiSnips.
- Learn how to work within Vim from different computers.
- Keybinding that comment multiple select lines (language dependent)
- Compatibility between ZSH and Vim keybindings for selecting files.
- Create my own functions that do the same as what the 'Vimball' plugins do.
- Start using 'Pathogen' or installing plugins manually to make Vim even more lightweight
- Create a method that could create C++ classes on the fly (.cpp and .h files with text inside)
- Like i3 resizing, enabling a mode that maps hjkl for resizing windows and then disables those keys.
- Organize keybindings in a such a way that each filetype has its own compilation/interpretation keybindings
- Create a function that given a list of file extensions (['tex', 'sta', 'pdf']), it returns a commands that delete all those files.
- Understand at a greater extent UltiSnips snippets (post_jump, priority)
